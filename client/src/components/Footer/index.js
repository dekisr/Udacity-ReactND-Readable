        <h2>About</h2>
        This project was made just for study purposes. I tried to put all my
        passion to build a bunch of functionalities from scratch. You can find
        more about and all the code at my GitHub. I'll appreciate any feedback.
      </p>
    </StyledFooter>

export default Footer
