## About
**Project Overview:**  
This is a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Nanodegree project that no longer exists. However, I decided to continue on my own for study purposes. The main goal was to build a Reddit like app to practice React and Redux.
Besides that, I took the opportunity to create and practice a lot of things. Like the React itself, React Router, Redux, JS, NodeJS, CSS Animations, RegEx, Web Sockets, Styled Components, etc.

A bunch of functionalities and other stuffs were made from scratch. Such the Toasts, Text Formatter, Notifications, Animations, Loadings, Error Handlings, Custom Users, All the design / Illustrations, Helper Functions and much more. Trying to keep all of that through correct Redux state, handling all possible errors, using optimistic updates and everything I learned from [Tyler McGinnis](https://tylermcginnis.com) classes. Also updating all the content with the web sockets from socket.io. There is a logger that you can check every action on the browser console.

**Content:**  
It is a simple app about colors. There are three categories, Red, Blue and Yellow. Users are generated randomly according to the name of CSS colors. You can vote, create new posts and comments, as well edit and delete them.
